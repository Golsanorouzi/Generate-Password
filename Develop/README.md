# Password Generator

This project was built with a starter code that needed to be completed.

This project's sole purpose was to write codes in JavaScript and build a website that would generate passwords after a series of prompts were asked.

## What is learned through this project?
Through this project I learned:

- The importance of the use of statements and keywords in JavaScript.

- The importance of variables when used correctly.

- The process in which logical decisions must be made in order for a JavaScript code to function properly.
